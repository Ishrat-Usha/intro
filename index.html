        Hi! My name is Ishrat, pronounced (ish-rut). Welcome to my GitHub page where you can learn a little bit about me. 
      </p>
      
      </p>
        I’m a very soon to be graduate from Baruch College with her diploma in Finance major/ philosophy minor as of upcoming December 2025, where I’ve taken several courses to strengthen my skills in communication, writing, research, and analytical thinking. Through both my time at college and my experience working in retail, pharmacy, and assisting, I’ve learned how to work face to face with diverse numbers of people from diverse backgrounds which has taught me how to stay calm under pressure, to pay attention to details, and to approach challenges with empathy. Both while working with kids and in retail I've had to face different circumtances which has taught me to be malleable to different situtions while still being able to form a bond of trust and understanding.
      </p>
      
       <p>
        I’m deeply passionate about my community and often advocate for the working class and anyone who is struggling and need a voice. While I haven’t been part of a large organizations yet, I’ve always tried to do my best in any way I can— whether it’s by spreading awareness, donating when I can, or prioritizing justice and compassion in the way I show up for others who need support. My main goal is to grow into someone who may be able to contribute on a bigger scale while working alongside knowledgable and likeminded individuals, and I’m eager to learn from people who are committed to creating those changes. 
       </p>

        <p>
        I also thoroughly enjoy being able to contribute to helping a establishment grow, weather thats people, creative work, or as a someone who helps to organize in the background. Whether I’m assisting customers, supporting my team-mates, or handling fast-paced tasks, I’m motivated by environments that value communication, empathy, and problem-solving. I enjoy roles where I can contribute to a supportive and organized workflow, and with every position I pursue, my goal is to grow into someone who brings reliability, clarity, and genuine care into the workplace. I’m eager to continue growing and developing my skills under teams that are mission-driven and committed to helping people. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Outside of academics, I’m a film/photography enthusiast. I love capturing thoughtful visuals, editing cinematic-style videos, and telling stories through imagery. Creativity is a big part of who I am and I also enjoy being able to communicate ideas through them.
