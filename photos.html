      <h2>Bangladesh</h2>
      <p>
        The second section includes shots from my Bangladesh trip in the Winter of 2025 visiting after nearly 10 years. I took pictures in the villages of Bangladesh, specifically the Southwestern region of known as Jessore. Along with seeing the riches of Bangladesh in the midst of winter, this trip helped me to step a foot in that door helping people which has only grown my enthusiam to work hard and try to do the same in NYC.
